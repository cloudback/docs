Our team is proud to announce to you the first public release of Cloudback - GitHub repository backup as a service. The decision to start the Cloudback project has been made a few months ago when we noticed there are no solutions that provide the ability to back up a GitHub repository into private cloud storage. We made this a key feature of our product - the integration with various cloud storage providers. Cloudback backs up a GitHub repository and its metadata and stores the resulting archive into your own storage facility. The supported storage providers are described in our documentation article [Various Backup Storages](https://docs.cloudback.it/features/various-backup-storages/).

Want to try it out? Visit our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.cloudback.it/getting-started/).

Currently, we are operating in a free and limited mode because of GitHub Marketplace restrictions. GitHub Marketplace allows publishing a paid plan after getting 100 installations. Until that, only a free plan can be published. Our free plan is limited to one repository per account. So we consider Cloudback in a public beta stage until paid plans are published.
