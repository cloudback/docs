Cloudback sends an email notification to the user if the backup fails. By default, we are using the primary email address taken from the GitHub profile. 

We received a feature request to support custom emails for notifications. This may be useful when you have a separate email for such kinds of notifications. We decided to provide such functionality for every account where the Cloudback GitHub Application is installed. Now you can set up a new email address for failed backup notifications for each account using the `Account Settings` dialog:
