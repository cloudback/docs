Today we reached 100+ installations and completed GitHub Marketplace financial onboarding. Now Cloudback meets all the requirements for GitHub Marketplace, including listing, billing, brand, and user experience requirements. It means that we completed the public beta stage, and now Cloudback is in production with no limits. 

We are glad to announce, that our new marketplace plans are available in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/cloudback)!

Our Free Plan remains active for all existing accounts but is discontinued and is no longer available for new users.

## About pricing plans

Cloudback has a straightforward pricing policy that we think will suit everyone starting from individual users and small startups up to large companies. Every pricing plan includes all [Cloudback features](/features). The only difference between plans is in the number of repositories included in the plan. Just choose the plan that suits you the most.
