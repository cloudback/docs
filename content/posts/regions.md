The Cloudback Team is excited to announce the addition of regional storage options for our clients. If you're utilizing Cloudback Storage for your repositories, you can now select from a variety of storage regions to best suit your needs. See the list of supported storage locations below:
 
|Storage name|Region|
|---|---|
| Cloudback US | USA East, N. Virginia |
| Cloudback EU | EU Central, Amsterdam |
| Cloudback UK | EU West, London |
| Cloudback Sidney | Asia, Australia, Sidney |
| Cloudback Singapore | Asia, Singapore |

By default, all backups are stored in the Cloudback US storage. However, clients can easily switch to their preferred storage location. To change the storage location for a specific repository please access the [back side](/features/card-view/#back-side-of-the-card) of the card view, or visit the [repository settings](/features/table-view/#repository-settings) within the table view.

As businesses continue to navigate the complexities of data management, Cloudback's commitment to providing secure, accessible, and compliant storage solutions is poised to drive growth and customer satisfaction.
