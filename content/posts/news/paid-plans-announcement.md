## About pricing plans

Cloudback has a simple pricing policy from individual users and small startups to enterprise-level companies. Every pricing plan includes all [Cloudback features](/features), and the only difference between plans is in the average price per repository. Simply choose the number of repositories you want to back up, and select the plan that suits you the most.
