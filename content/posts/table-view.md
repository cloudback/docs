The Cloudback team is happy to announce that an alternative view for Cloudback Dashboard is released. It is a **Table View**. Using **table view** it is much easier to navigate through a large number of repositories and trigger on-demand backups. We put the `Table View Toggle` in the header, so it is always easy to switch to the `Table View` and back to the `Card View`. It was a feature request of our client and we are glad to deliver it. Please don't hesitate to share your feedback and usage experience in the comments or by email team@cloudback.it.
