We are delighted to announce the start of our transition from **MYRTLE GROUP S.A.** to a dedicated legal entity, **MYRTLELABS S.A.S.**, as part of our pursuit of SOC2 certification.

**MYRTLELABS S.A.S.**, a newly formed legal entity, will handle all IT projects of **MYRTLE GROUP S.A.**, detailed on our website at https://myrtle-sa.com. This strategic change will accelerate our compliance with SOC2 certification requirements, enabling us to offer you certified services more swiftly.

### A step towards SOC2 certification

This transition is the first step in our journey towards achieving SOC 2 certification, a globally recognized independent auditing standard for security, availability, and confidentiality. SOC 2 certification demonstrates our dedication to robust security practices and empowers us to better serve our customers with the peace of mind they deserve.

### No impact on our customers

We understand the importance of seamless transitions, and we want to assure you that this shift will have no impact on your experience with our services. You'll continue to enjoy the same level of service and support you've come to expect from us.

### For invoiced customers paying by bank transfer

The only minor change you might encounter is if you are an invoiced customer who currently pays by bank transfer. Your upcoming invoices will reflect a new bank account and legal entity under **MYRTLELABS S.A.S.** We will ensure you receive clear and timely communication regarding these updates.

### Our commitment to security and transparency

We are confident that this transition will further strengthen our security posture and allow us to deliver an even more reliable and secure experience for our customers. We remain committed to transparency throughout this process and will keep you informed of any further developments.

Thank you for your continued trust and support. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
