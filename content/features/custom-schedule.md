# Custom Schedules

Cloudback provides build-in schedules for daily backups out of the box. If you want to backup on a weekly or monthly basis, you can create your own schedule using the `Schedule Manager` from the `Main Menu`. Once you create your own schedule, it becomes available in the `Schedule` dropdown box of repository settings.

Let's create `Every Monday Morning` schedule for weekly backups step-by-step:

1. Open the `Schedule Manager` from the `Main Menu`.
2. Click the `Add a new schedule` button at the bottom right corner, it will open the `Add Schedule` dialog.
3. Type **"Every Monday Morning"** into the `Schedule name` text box
4. Choose **"4"** in the `Specific hour (choose one or many)` section. It means backup will start at 4 am.
