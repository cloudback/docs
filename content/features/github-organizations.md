# GitHub Organizations

Cloudback supports shared team accounts called `GitHub Organization`. You can purchase a paid plan in [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/cloudback) for your organization's account and repositories will appear in Cloudback Dashboard. This way several team members may configure and control backups for your organizations using a single shared dashboard. 

Please note that only organization members with the role `Owner` will be able to access the organization's repositories in Cloudback.
