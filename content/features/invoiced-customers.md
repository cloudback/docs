# Invoiced Customers

For those who hold **GitHub Enterprise** accounts and/or settle their GitHub payments through invoices, it's important to note that you will not be able to acquire paid plans from Cloudback via the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Any attempts to do so will result in an error message `Unfortunately, invoiced customers cannot purchase paid plans on the GitHub Marketplace`.

However, there is a positive twist to this situation. Cloudback provides an alternative option in the form of direct bank transfers for payment. Simply [get in touch](/contact-us/) with us, and we'll organize a complimentary trial period for you.
