# Download Backups

You can download an archive of any backup of your repositories. There is the `Download this backup` button in the repository card:

## Download dialog

Once you click the `Download this backup` button the dialog will be shown. The dialog reminds you that the archive's password will be sent to your email right after the download process is initiated.

## Archive's password email

You will receive an email with the password each time you download a repository backup:

## What if the file is deleted?

There are a few situations when we could not download a backup archive:

- The archive file has been removed from the storage
- The archive file has been moved to another location
- The storage is not available or is not accessible

In any of these cases you will get the `File not found` notification:
