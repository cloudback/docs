# One-Click Manual Backups

Cloudback allows you to trigger a backup process on demand by clicking a single button. There are several use-cases when manual backups are useful:

- You want to download [your up-to-date data](features/metadata), no need to wait for an automatic trigger
- You want to test [your own storage](/features/various-backup-storages) that you configured recently
- You want to secure your data at a specific point in time

## Trigger a backup

Once your repository is scheduled, just click a button and trigger a backup, that's all:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/static/features/manual-backup-trigger.png" data-alt="/static/features/manual-backup-trigger.gif"
       alt="Trigger a manual backup" onclick="swapGif(this)" style="cursor: pointer;"/>
</p>

## Email notification are disabled for manual backups
