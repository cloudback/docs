# Restore to GitHub

Cloudback allows you to restore a particular backup into a GitHub repository. This is a manual operation accessible from the repository card in the Cloudback Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

The restore process requires read-write access to your GitHub data. Permissions are managed by [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/connecting-with-third-party-applications#types-of-application-access-and-data) applications. [Cloudback](https://github.com/apps/cloudback) GitHub application has read-only access only, according to the least privilege principle. We published an additional [Cloudback Restore](https://github.com/apps/cloudback-restore) GitHub application with read-write access to your data. This application should be installed for a short period of time, while the restore is in progress. Once restore is done the application should be uninstalled.

When you click the `Restore this backup` button Cloudback will ask you to install the Restore application:

## Restore to a new repository

If the [Cloudback Restore](https://github.com/apps/cloudback-restore) GitHub application is installed you will be asked to enter a new repository name. When you click the `Restore` button, we immediately create an empty repository and initiate a restore process that runs in the background. The status is displayed in the repository card:

       alt="Restore to repository" onclick="swapGif(this)" style="cursor: pointer;"/>
</p>

Once restore is finished please follow the link `Open restored repository` to open GitHub and verify the resulting repository:
