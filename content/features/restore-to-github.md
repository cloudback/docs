# Restore to GitHub

Cloudback allows you to restore any backup to a new GitHub repository. This is a manual process, accessible from the repository card in the Cloudback Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

The restore process requires read and write access to your GitHub data, but the [Cloudback](https://github.com/apps/cloudback) app has read-only access, following the principle of least privilege. We have released an additional application [Cloudback Restore](https://github.com/apps/cloudback-restore) with read and write access to your data. This application should be installed for a short period of time while the restore is running. Once the restore is complete, you should uninstall the application.

When you click on the `Restore this backup` button, Cloudback will prompt you to install the 'Restore' application:

## Restore to a new repository

In the `Restore` dialog you will be prompted to enter a new repository name and a target account name (owner). After that you will be asked to install the [Cloudback Restore](https://github.com/apps/cloudback-restore) GitHub application, if it is not installed yet. Once installation is done Cloudback creates an empty repository and initiates a restore process that runs in the background. The status is displayed in the repository card:

</p>

Once restore is finished please follow the link `Open restored repository` to open GitHub and verify the resulting repository:
